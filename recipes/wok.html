    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I couldn't find a good lo mein recipe on here, so I'm posting mine. I made
      it this week and my roommate and I agreed that it was possibly the best
      that we've ever had.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 package spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dark sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon peanut oil</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>4 cups mixed vegetables</li>
      <li>1 pound flank steak, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Asian chile paste with garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12
        minutes; drain and transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle sesame oil over the
        spaghetti; toss to coat. Place a plate atop the bowl to keep the noodles
        warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook
        and stir garlic and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        Add mixed vegetables to the skillet; cook and stir until slightly
        tender, about 3 minutes. Stir flank steak into the vegetable mixture;
        cook and stir until the beef is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix soy sauce, brown sugar, oyster sauce, and chile paste together in a
        small bowl; pour over the spaghetti. Dump spaghetti and sauce mixture
        into the wok with the vegetables and steak; cook and stir until the
        spaghetti is hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
